FitSage is a minimal, modern fitness web app that transforms your natural workout diaries into structured insights and recommendations. Built for casual exercisers who want clarity and guidance without the hassle of complex data entry.

## Why We Built This

Most fitness apps overwhelm users with complex data entering or make tracking feel like a chore. We wanted something different - an app that understands you're just trying to stay active, not become a data scientist.

The idea was simple: what if you could just write about your workout like you're talking to a friend, and the app would figure out the rest? That's what FitSage does. It takes your casual diary entries and turns them into structured workout data, progress insights, and helpful suggestions - all powered by AI.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Diary**: Write freely without worrying about grammar, get structured workout summaries and suggestions in seconds
- **Smart Workout Recognition**: Recognizes 40+ workout types from casual mentions to structured exercises
- **Progress Visualization**: Simple charts showing your activity patterns and trends
- **Personalized Suggestions**: AI-generated tips based on your actual workout history
- **Personal Dashboard**: See your intensities, body stats, and recent workouts at a glance
- **Secure Authentication**: Quick, safe sign-in and sign-out process
